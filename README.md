**# Sales-Dashboard and Forecasting (Interactive dashboard creation by Power BI)**

I have created an intermediate-level comprehensive dashboard in Power BI using multiple graphs and charts. The dashboard was developed in various stages, including sourcing data from Kaggle, performing data modelling, and generating insights.

**Project Objective**
The project aims to strengthen my Power BI skills by working through each stage of dashboard creation. I created this project to learn how to use the advanced chart option and forecast data.

Dataset used
<a href ="https://github.com/abhishek3852/Sales-dashboard/blob/main/sales_data_sample.csv"> Sample sales data</a>

**Question?**

● What is the number of orders per product line?

● Which country has the highest total sales?

● What are the forecasted sales for the next six months?

● What is the overall sales trend over time?

● Is there a relationship between order volume and the number of customers in each country?

● What is the status of the orders?
