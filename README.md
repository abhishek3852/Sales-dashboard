**# Sales-Dashboard and Forecasting (Interactive dashboard creation by Power BI)**
I have created an intermediate-level comprehensive dashboard in Power BI using multiple graphs and charts. The dashboard was developed in various stages, including sourcing data from Kaggle, performing data modelling, and generating insights.

**Project Objective**
The project aims to strengthen my Power BI skills by working through each stage of dashboard creation. I created this project to learn how to use the advanced chart option and forecast data.
